# Personal workout logger

# Overview
## Description
This project is a simple workout logger/tracker for personal useage.

## Project motivation
When deciding to start to get back in shape i felt the need to track my progress. After searching for an app to help me with that i have failed to find an app that is easy-to-use, free and  has unrestricted exercises selection.
After trying for about a week to track my progress with a pyhsical pen and paper, I have realized that I would often forget to track my workouts when coming back home or even forgetting the number of sets and reps for a given exercise. 

Recognizing those problems I have decided to implement a website that I can track my progress anywhere even while working out.

## Project goals
Besides having a functional workout tracker for my personal use I would also want to learn web technologies and languages like Typescript, React/Svelte and more.

The learning part will be 'Vanilla' useage of the languages at first and after sometime will switch to web frameworks like NextJS/ExpressJS.
